# Vue Enterprise Boilerplate

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/tree/master)

> This is an ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue SPA projects using [Vue CLI 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Questions, feedback, and for now, even bikeshedding are welcome. ðŸ˜„ If you'd like to increase the time I can spend on this project, as well as other Vue resources, **please consider becoming a [sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/chrisvuefritz)**. :pray:

**:warning: This project uses Vue CLI 3, which is currently in beta so may not yet be appropriate for production projects.**

## Features

* [**Thorough documentation**](#documentation): Written with the same care as Vue's core docs to quickly train new team members and consolidate knowledge.
* [**Guaranteed consistency**](docs/linting.md): Opinionated linting for Vue, JavaScript/JSON, SCSS, and Markdown, integrated into Visual Studio Code and run against staged files on pre-commit.
* [**First-class tests**](docs/tests.md): Practice test-driven development with both unit and end-to-end tests. Unit tests with Jest live as first-class citizens alongside your source files, while Cypress provides reliable end-to-end tests in an intuitive GUI for development.
* [**Speedy development**](docs/development.md): Between [configurable generators](docs/development.md#generators), [handy aliases](docs/development.md#aliases), and [global base components](docs/development.md#base-components), your productivity will skyrocket.
