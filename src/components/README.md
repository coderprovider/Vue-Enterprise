# Components

This is the general components folder. Beyond `app.vue`, page, and layout components, all others will live here. See the [Vue Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) for recommended rules on crafting these components, but of particular note is that components prefixed with `app-` are automatically registered globally and so don't have to be imported explicitly to be used.
